  imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  description: "Product description",
  price: 99.99,
  topSelling: true,
  category: "electronics"
});
```

## Part 5: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Products not loading**: Check that your Apps Script URL is correct in `script.js`

3. Test search and filter functionality
