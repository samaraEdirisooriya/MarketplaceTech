# Deployment Options for ElectroHub

## Option 1: Direct GitHub Pages (Static Only)

### What works:
- Website design and layout
- Theme toggle and animations
- Search, filter, and sort (on demo products)
- WhatsApp integration
- All visual features

### What doesn't work:
- Real-time Google Sheets data loading
- Will show demo products only

### Steps to deploy:
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all files: index.html, style.css, script.js, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Website will be live at: https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname

## Option 2: Google Apps Script Backend (Full Functionality)

### What works:
- Everything from Option 1
- Real-time Google Sheets integration
- Dynamic product loading
- Full API functionality

### Implementation:
1. Create a Google Apps Script project
2. Set up CORS-enabled API endpoints
3. Modify frontend to call Apps Script instead of direct Sheets API
4. Deploy Apps Script as web app
5. Upload frontend to GitHub Pages

### Benefits:
- No server costs
- Automatic scaling
- Real-time data updates
- Full Google Sheets integration

## Recommendation:
For a production website with Google Sheets functionality, I recommend Option 2 (Google Apps Script). It's free, scalable, and maintains all features.

Would you like me to implement the Google Apps Script solution?
